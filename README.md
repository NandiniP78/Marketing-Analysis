##  Background & Overview  
Marketing data is often spread across multiple systemsâ€”customer records, product catalogs, engagement logs, and unstructured reviews. To unify this data, the project builds a **star-schema marketing data warehouse** in SQL Server, applies **sentiment analysis** on customer reviews using Python, and integrates results into a **Power BI dashboard** for interactive insights.  

## Business Problem
ShopEasy, an online retail business, is facing reduced customer engagement and conversion rates despite launching several new online marketing campaigns. They want to conduct a detailed analysis and identify areas for improvement in their marketing strategies.

The pipeline includes:  
- **SQL Server** â†’ Fact & dimension tables for structured data.  
- **Python (NLP)** â†’ Sentiment classification of customer reviews.  
- **Power BI + DAX** â†’ Visualization of KPIs across products, channels, and customer segments.  

## Dataset Overview  
This project integrates both **structured** and **unstructured** marketing data sources:  

- **Customer Dimension (`dim_customers`)**  
  - Attributes: CustomerID, demographics, region, and segmentation details.  

- **Product Dimension (`dim_products`)**  
  - Attributes: ProductID, category, brand, and price range.  

- **Fact Tables**  
  - `fact_customer_journey`: Tracks customer touchpoints across marketing channels (e.g., ads, email, social media).  
  - `fact_customers_review`: Stores product/service reviews enriched with sentiment labels.  
  - `fact_engagement_data`: Contains engagement metrics such as impressions, clicks, conversions.  

- **Customer Reviews Dataset (`customer_review_sentiment.xlsx`)**  
  - Source: Text reviews processed with Python NLP pipeline.  
  - Columns: ReviewID, CustomerID, ProductID, ReviewText, PredictedSentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative).  

- **Calendar Table (DAX Script)**  
  - Generated using DAX for time-based calculations in Power BI (e.g., YoY growth, monthly trends).
