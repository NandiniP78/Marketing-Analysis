### Background & Overview
Marketing data is often spread across multiple systems—customer records, product catalogs, engagement logs, and unstructured reviews. To unify this data, the project builds a star-schema marketing data warehouse in SQL Server, applies sentiment analysis on customer reviews using Python, and integrates results into a Power BI dashboard for interactive insights.

The pipeline includes:
SQL Server → Fact & dimension tables for structured data.
Python (NLP) → Sentiment classification of customer reviews.
Power BI + DAX → Visualization of KPIs across products, channels, and customer segments.
